# Tiny Habits

---

### Question 1  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was that motivation is unreliable, and instead of waiting to feel motivated, we should make habits tiny and easy. BJ Fogg’s example of doing just two push-ups showed that success comes from making the behavior so small.

### Question 2  
**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

BJ Fogg’s Behavior Formula:

> **B = MAP**  
> Behavior happens when **Motivation**, **Ability**, and **Prompt** come together.

- **M – Motivation** 
- **A – Ability**
- **P – Prompt**

To make new habits easier:
- Don’t depend too much on **Motivation**
- Increase **Ability** by making the habit very small.
- Attach the habit to a clear **Prompt**

### Question 3  
**Why is it important to “Shine” or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?**

Celebration creates a positive emotion, and emotion wires the habit into your brain.  

According to BJ Fogg:
> “Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.”

Celebrating:
- Reinforces the behavior neurologically.
- Makes your brain want to repeat it.
- Builds momentum and identity.
- Turns small success into lasting habits.

Even saying “Yes!” or smiling creates a success signal in your brain.

### Question 4  
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was that small improvements compound over time. Getting just 1% better every day may seem small, but over a year, it creates massive growth.

The idea emphasizes:
- Focus on progress, not perfection.
- Small habits create exponential long-term success.

### Question 5  
**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book explains that real change happens when you focus on identity, not just goals.

Instead of saying:
> “I want to run a marathon.”

Say:
> “I am becoming a runner.”
